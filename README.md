### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying computer engineering at Middle East Technical University. My focus will be on AI and NLP combined with cognitive science and I plan on a PhD when I graduate.
My current focus is to learn and experience as much as I can in the software industry and work on myself to prepare for my future plans. 
You can contact me at metehanerdogan87@gmail.com or e258991@metu.edu.tr.
